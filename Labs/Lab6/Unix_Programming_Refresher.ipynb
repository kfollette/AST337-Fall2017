We start with a list of objects -- in this example a list of strings, but it could be anything -- and then we say for variable in list:, followed by a block of code. The code inside the block will be executed once for every item in the list, and when it is executed the variable will be set equal to the appropriate list item. In this example, the list names had four objects in it, each a string. Thus the print statement inside the loop was executed four times. The first time it was executed, the variable n was set equal to `Henrietta`. The second time n was set equal to `Annie`, then `Jocelyn`, then `Vera`.\n",
