    "**Cepheid variable stars** are intrinsic variable stars which pulsate in a predictable way. Furthermore, a Cepheid star's period (how often it pulsates) is directly related to its luminosity or brightness. Cepheid variables are extremely luminous and very distant ones can be observed and measured.\n",
