For example, the `np.sin` function takes an angle as an argument, and calculates the sine of that angle. In this example our function has two arguments.

It is also possible to write functions where the number of arguments is variable, and need not be the same every time the function is called.\n",

In python, indentation is used to indicate that a particular line belongs to a particular function, loop, or other block of code. All the lines of the function are indented four spaces. If you're using entering this manually in ipython, either at the command line or in the notebook, you don't need to type in those four spaces by hand; the ipython shell will automatically enter them for you after seeing the def line. If you're using emacs or another text editor, you can just hit the tab key and the correct number of spaces will be entered for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the body of the function, we can enter whatever commands we like. We can print things, for example. Or do a calculation. The arguments in that appeared in parentheses in the definition are accessible within the function, and can be manipulated however we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the function, we have a statement that begins return. A return function causes the function to give back a value, which the calling program can print, assign to a variable, or do something else with. For example, the `np.log10` function returns the base 10 log for any positive number (or **array** of numbers!). Return values are optional: functions don't have to return anything, and can just end.\n",
