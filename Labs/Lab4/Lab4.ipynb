    "We've created a python object called data above, but data is a special type of python object called an HDUlist, which is more or less just a list of python objects. The .fits file format can have many extensions besides just a data array and a header (other data arrays, other text files, etc.). In most cases in astronomy, and in probably all the cases for this class, we are only concerned with the first object in the list, which contains the main data array and header. This first object has index 0. One useful method for an HDUlist is .info, which will tell you about how many objects are in the list. If you execute the cell below, you can see that there's only one, called PRIMARY, and .info also lists its dimensions and the type of numbers stored in the array (64-bit floats)"
